## This branch is most upto date but will but will have big bugs

GLE game framework / engine or App framework / engine idk
A basic GLFW framework for graphics

This project is being developed on an old linix machine witch is not that fast this project will be developed on linix first, then might get windows support. I am writing this for run and in my free time updates and new features will take time.
